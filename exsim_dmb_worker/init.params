!Note: Force program to use Wells and Coppersmith (WC) for FL and/or FW if
! either entry = 0.0.
! If Wells and Coppersmith are used to obtain FL and/or FW, the WC values are
! modified to account for the scaling implied by differences in the stress
! specified above and a stress that is assumed to be valid for the generic WC
! relations; this stress is stress_ref. The value of 70 bars is an educated
! guess for stress_ref, but it is not based on a quantitative analysis.
! The WC values of FL and/or FW are multiplied by the factor
! (stress_ref/stress)^(1/3).
